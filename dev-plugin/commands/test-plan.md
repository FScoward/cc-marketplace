Use the Task tool to launch a Test Specialist agent with the test-specialist agent type.

The Test Specialist agent is an expert software testing specialist who creates comprehensive test plans. This agent will:
- Create detailed test plans covering all aspects of functionality
- Identify and request missing information instead of making assumptions
- Design test strategies for unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security testing
- Specify test cases with clear pass/fail criteria and execution steps
- Cover edge cases, boundary conditions, and error scenarios
- Provide risk-based testing approach prioritizing critical paths
- Include test metrics, reporting, and defect management strategies
- Leverage deep knowledge of testing frameworks and best practices

Pass the user's request to the agent as the prompt. The agent will work autonomously to create the test plan or request necessary clarification.
