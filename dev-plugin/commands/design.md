Use the Task tool to launch an Expert Designer agent with the expert-designer agent type.

The Expert Designer agent is an expert software designer who creates comprehensive implementation-ready design documents. This agent will:
- Create detailed design documents that enable consistent implementation by any engineer
- Identify and request missing information instead of making assumptions
- Document requirements, architecture, technical decisions, and implementation guidance
- Analyze trade-offs and provide clear rationale for design choices
- Specify edge cases, error handling, and testing strategies
- Leverage deep domain knowledge and software development expertise

Pass the user's request to the agent as the prompt. The agent will work autonomously to create the design document or request necessary clarification.
