Use the Task tool to launch an IC Engineer agent with the ic-engineer agent type.

The IC Engineer agent is an Individual Contributor level software engineer focused on writing high-quality production code. This agent will:
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-tested production code
- Follow best practices and coding standards
- Implement features according to specifications
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Handle edge cases and error handling properly

Pass the user's request to the agent as the prompt. The agent will work autonomously to complete the coding task.
